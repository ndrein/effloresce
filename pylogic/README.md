Nearly nothing, documentation is taken from the author website, source code is the same, I've just added
a setup.py for easier deployment and imported the documentation in this Readme.md.


Description
===========

A python module for validation of propositional and first-order logic
statements.

Simple software verification can be achieved through use of this module. A basic
scenario is when you wish to confirm that some state is achieved after running a
block of code.  Typically this is done through unit tests. The trouble with unit
tests is that they require much effort to set up and typically only test as many
cases as the programmer's time can afford. Unit tests can be augmented with a
simple model that enumerates a representative set of inputs so that a logical
statement can be validated with a single call to logic.validate() or
Context.validate().

The simplest use of the logic module is to check the validity of propositional
logic statements. To evaluate propositional logic statements, see
logic.validate() or Context.validate(). Truth tables can also be printed with
Context.printTruthTable().

Unless you're testing very simple conditions and testing your logic, you
probably want to use first-order logic so that you can specify sets, define
relationships (between objects in a domain), and test using quantifiers (that a
statement is true for at least one object in the domain, or all objects).
Statements are verified by use of the Context.validate() function. A domain of
objects can be set on the context with Context.setTermDomain(), which takes a
list.

Predicate functions can be defined either implicitly or explicitly. Implicit
predicate functions are defined through a call to Context.assume(sentence) or
Context.assumePredicate(predicate). Context.assume(sentence) will infer which
predicate invocations must be true in order to make sentence true.
Context.assumePredicate(predicate) will tell the logic engine that predicate is
necessarily true without requiring inferencing. Using this method leads to more
optimal performance in the validate() function. Finally Python functions can be
used to define predicate functions. You can tell a Context to use a Python
function by passing the function in as an argument to
Context.setPredicateFunction(function, arity).

For further documentation see individual function documentation or
logic_examples.py

Note: logic_examples.py is simply a self-documenting Python module full of example usage. It is not
a necessary file for use of logic.py, but it should provide ample examples that can be copied
and modified.

Install
=======

To install pylogic:


```shell
#exec as root
./setup.py install
```

It will install logic.py, yacc.py and lex.py in pylogic module.

Propositional Logic
-------------------

Propositional logic statements can be validated using logic.py, meaning their truth can be easily computed and returned as a Python bool. Depending on the situation, the user may wish to test that a logical statement is true for all valuations of all possible atoms (ie. that the statement is a tautology), that it is true for at least one valuation (ie. that the statement is satisfiable), or in cases where the statement is not a tautology, to print out a truth table showing the valuations that make the statement false.

## Grammar  ##

All public functions take a string as an argument that defines the statement to be validated. This logic string must conform to the syntax specified by logic.py. The grammar is designed in such a way to make logical statements simple to construct and easy to read. For this reason propositional atoms are allowed to be any string that begins with a [ and ends with a ].

The full grammar for propositional logic is specified by the following table: 

```
<atom>      ::= [any string in these brackets]   
   <formula>    ::= <formula> implies <formula>                 
            | <formula> therefore <formula>                 
            | <formula> or <formula>                 
            | <formula> and <formula>                 
            | not <formula>                 
            | {<formula>}                    
            | <atom> 
```
As with the usual precedence rules of propositional logic, the order of operations is not, and, or, implies, where therefore is synonymous with implies and is added as syntactic sugar to aid readability of logical sentences that would include the symbol `.

We can translate a traditional logical statement to our more human and machine-friendly syntax:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/kakwa/pylogic/master/doc/images/prop-log-1.png"/>

becomes:


```
not [P] implies {[R] and [Q]} therefore [R] or [P]
```

## logic.validate() ##

The logic.validate() method is used to evaluate a string that represents a logical statement specifies in the above syntax. This function can be called directly from the logic module without instantiating any class objects. 

logic.validate() takes a string as an argument and returns a Python bool that is True if the logical statement is a tautology (meaning all possible valuations of propositional atoms lead to the statement being true), and False otherwise.

## logic.satisfiable() ##

Unlike logic.validate(), logic.satisfiable() returns True if there is at least one valuation of the propositional atoms in the logical statement that lead to the statement being true. This method returns a bool, so in order to determine details about the valuation for the atoms that led to this statement’s truth, you must call Context.printTruthTable().

## The Context Object ##

The Context object contains the state information that gets created in setting up or evaluating a logical statement. It also provides further control. With the Context object you can do perform two additional functions: printing a truth table, and specifing assumptions before calling validate().

The Context object is created with the one line call:

```python
c = logic.Context()
```

At this point you can print a truth table, which will simply produce a column for each propositional atom and one for the formula that the user passes in as an argument. It will not produce columns for any sub-formulas. As an optional second argument, the printTruthTable() function will take a string that will serve as the column separator in the printed output. By default this separator is a tab character.

```python
c = logic.Context()
c.printTruthTable("[P] and [Q] or [P] and [Q]", ",")


# This prints out the following:


# Q,P,{{{[P] and [Q]} or [P]} and [Q]}
# False,False,False
# True,False,False
# False,True,False
# True,True,True
```

The Context object will also accept a number of logical formulas as assumptions against which subsequent calls to validate() will be evaluated. For example, the statement:


```python
{{{[P] and [Q]} and [R]} and {[S] and [T]}} implies {[Q] and [S]}
```

can be simplified with the use of assumptions:


```python
import logic
context = logic.Context()
context.assume("[P] and [Q] and [R]")
context.assume("[S] and [T]")
print str(context.validate("[Q] and [S]"))
# prints out "True"
```

With the last call to context.validate(), the Context object will reconstruct the longer sentence that includes the implication out of all of the assumptions that it knows about. In other words, all assumptions are composed in a conjunction. The formula in the validate() method will then be combined with an implication, and the resulting formula will be evaluated, with its truth being returned by validate().

First-Order Logic
-----------------

Formulas in first-order logic are also supported by logic.py. First-order logic is an important feature as it allows the user to test pre and post-conditions of her code using predicate functions.

Predicate functions are extensions of propositional atoms. They are like propositional atoms but they are allowed to take a finite number of arguments. These arguments are objects (strings, integers, or any object that can have a unique id) and they must belong to a user-specified domain. The objects, or terms, may be relevant to the code that is in test. For instance, if the user were to test that a sorting algorithm worked correctly over a list, he might set the domain to be all objects in the list and check to see that for all items in the domain, their relative positions in the list are based on their ordering.

In order to use first-order logical validation, there are three features that need to be understood: terms, predicate functions, and the grammar for using quantifiers.

## Terms ##

As previously stated, terms are objects that can serve as an argument to a predicate function. Terms belong to a finite list that determines the pool of all possible values. This is called the domain. The domain for terms can be specified on a Context object with a call to Context.setTermDomain().

Context.setTermDomain() takes just a single argument, a Python list.

For instance:

```python
c.setTermDomain(["apple", "orange", "banana", "carrot"])
```

sets the domain to be four fruits and vegetables. But since the Context can take any Python list, it is not confined to just strings. A finite range for integers can be easily created using the Python range() function:

```python
c.setTermDomain(range(20))
```

which sets the domain to be all integers from 0-19 inclusive. Note that while the current version (1.0) of logic.py supports setting a domain with a list of any type, strange behavior can occur if the objects in the domain list are not unique when cast as strings.

## Predicate Functions ##

Predicate functions can be defined implicitly or explicitly. Implicitly defined predicate functions are those that are added to an assume() or assumePredicate() function. By doing this, the user does not have to explicitly write a function and register it with the Context, which can save some time for simple models:

```python
context.assumePredicate("orange colored(orange)")
context.assumePredicate("orange colored(carrot)")
```

Here we have restated the previous assumption in two calls to assumePredicate(). This tells the Context object to remember that “orange colored” is true for an orange and a carrot. Using the regular assume() method requires that the validate() function do some extra work to infer which values in the domain must be true in order to make the assumption true.

Note that with assumePredicate() you omit the square brackets.

Sometimes it’s too costly and tedious to enumerate all terms in the domain that make a particular predicate function true. This is especially the case for something simple like the predicate is odd(x). Considering a possible domain of 100 values, this would require 50 assumptions to be manually entered by the user, whereas a Python function could be defined in one line that determines if x is odd. For this reason, there are explicitly defined predicate functions.

Any Python function can be set on the Context object. In order to do this, the Python function must first be defined, and its arity known. The function and its arity are passed to the Context.setPredicateFunction() function:

```python
context = logic.Context()
# define our predicate function, cast all arguments to ints!
# the validator will stringify them before passing them here
def greater_than(x, y):
   return int(x) > int(y)


context.setTermDomain(range(10))
# tell the context about our predicate function, with arity 2
context.setPredicateFunction(greater_than,2)


print str(context.validate("[greater_than(5,2)]")) # prints True 
```

This example shows how predicate functions with a positive arity can be used to explain the relationship between two numbers. Beware of using functions with too-high of an arity. Existential and universal quantifiers can be evaluated at roughly O(n) for a domain of length n and a predicate function with arity 1.

If a predicate function has arity a however, this becomes O(n^a), so a seemingly harmless domain defined by c.setTermDomain(range(100)) with a predicate of arity 3 now leads to 1,000,000 invocations of that predicate function. In practice the validate() method isn’t quite so inefficient. It will at least not call the predicate function a second time if it has already been executed with the same arguments.

## Grammar with First-Order Quantifiers ##

Finally, the universal (all x) and existential (exists x) quantifiers allow to shine all of the infrastructure that we have set up. You can evaluate logical statements that check if there is a term in the domain that makes a formula true at least once (through exists x) or if a formula is true for all terms in the domain (with all x). The first-order quantifiers can be combined and ordered to express a greater number of possibilities.

The full gramar with quantifiers included is:

```
<atom>  ::=     [any string in these brackets]


   <function>  ::=     [any string(comma separated list)]
   
   <variable>  ::=     a single word (no spaces)
 
    <formula>  ::=     <formula> implies <formula>
                     | <formula> therefore <formula>
                     | <formula> or <formula>
                     | <formula> and <formula>
                     | exists <variable> <formula>
                     | all <variable> <formula>
                     | not <formula>
                     | {<formula>}  
                     | <function>
                     | <atom> 
```

This grammar is somewhat loosely defined here, with <function>, <atom>, and <variable> as human readable strings instead of the conventional Backus-Naur Form.

The exists operator is exemplified here: 

```python

context = logic.Context()
# define our predicate function, cast all arguments to ints!
# the validator will stringify them before passing them here
def greater_than(x, y):
    return int(x) > int(y)


context.setTermDomain(range(10))
# tell the context about our predicate function, with arity 2
context.setPredicateFunction(greater_than,2)


print str(context.validate("exists x {[greater_than(x,5)]}")) # prints True 
```

Here a domain is set up that includes all integers from 0-9 inclusive. A predicate function, greater than() is explicitly defined and registered with te context. Finally in the last line we print out the validity of a statement which tests whether there is a variable, x in the domain such that x > 5. This statement is trivially true since the domain includes 6.

An example of the universal quantifier in use:

```python
context = logic.Context()


context.assumePredicate("is a fruit(banana)")
context.assumePredicate("is a fruit(apple)")


context.setTermDomain(["banana", "apple", "carrot"])


print str(context.validate("all  x {[is a fruit(x)]}")) # prints False
```

Here we set the term domain to include three food items and implicitly define a predicate, is a fruit that is true for only “banana” and “apple”. Finally the statement all x {[is a fruit(x)]} is validated and returns False.
