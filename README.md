## Goal

This is an experiment with logical formulas in its early stages.

Hopefully, we'll end up having the ability to compute truth given a logical model.


## Implementation


Right now, we're working on parsing logical formulas into parse trees.

This project uses `ndrein/syntax` as a parsing implementation for the time being.

See `effloresce/syntax/scanning/logic_scanner.py` and `effloresce/syntax/parsing/logic.cfg`.
